== How to Use this Manual

=== Syntax Conventions
// Lifted from qbasic.net
* *`KEYWORDS`*: Items in capital letters indicate BASIC keywords.
  Keywords are a required part of the statement syntax, unless they are
  enclosed in brackets. You must spell keywords correctly.
* *`placeholders`*: Items in lowercase are placeholders for information you
  must supply in the statement, such as a filename.
* *`[optional item]`*: Items inside square brackets do not need to be used
  in the statement.
* *`<choice1|choice2>`*: Angle brackets and a vertical bar indicate a
  choice between two or more items. You must use one of the items in the
  statement unless the angle brackets are enclosed in square brackets, e.g.
  `[<optional1|optional2>]`.
* *`item, item, ...`* means several of the preceding items can be used in a
  single-line statement.

NOTE: The uppercase and lowercase syntax notation conventions are used to
help you read the syntax rules for a statement, and are _not_ capitalization
rules you must type in. Neither keywords nor variable and procedure names
are case-sensitive.

=== Terminology

* *Video memory* refers to all random-access memory residing on the video
  controller chip.
* *Pixel memory* refers to the parts of video memory that represent pixels,
  including the visible screen and the off-screen area that can be accessed
  by graphics commands and functions.
* A *range* is a way to specify a set of numbers by giving a start and/or
  an end. The following forms are allowed: +
+
[options="autowidth,1"]
|===
| _num_  | A single number.
| -_num_ | All numbers up to and including _num_
| _num_- | All numbers from _num_.
| _num1_-_num2_ | All numbers between _num1_ and _num2_, inclusive.

== Data Types

=== Arrays
Arrays must be dimensioned using the <<DIM>> command, which can also be used
to resize and re-dimension them at any time. In the case of numeric arrays,
the current values will be maintained. For string arrays, the existing values
will be deleted.

If the <<DIM>> command is used to create a one-dimensional array, it can be
followed by an `=` sign and a list of initial values separated by commas and
enclosed in angular brackets (`[` and `]`).

==== Examples
Creating an uninitialized two-dimensional numeric array of size 4x6:
----
DIM A(4, 6)
----
Creating an initialized one-dimensional string array:
----
DIM A$(2) = ["one", "two", "three"]
----
Accessing an array element:
----
PRINT A$(0)
one
----

=== Lists
Similar to arrays, lists are data types that contain zero or more elements of a
specific simple type (numbers or strings). List names start with the character `~`.

Lists are more dynamic than arrays and allow items to be added and removed freely,
using the <<POPB()>>, <<POPF()>>, <<POPB$()>> and <<POPF$()>> functions and the
<<APPEND>> and <<PREPEND>> commands.

Individual elements can be accessed in the same way as array elements.

Lists are always one-dimensional. The current length of a list can be determined
using the <<LEN()>> function.

==== Examples
Appending a list element:
----
APPEND ~A$, "Tom"
----
Accessing an element:
----
PRINT ~A$(0)
Tom
~A$(0) = "Jerry"
----
Removing a list element from the beginning of the list:
----
element$ = POPF$(~A$)
PRINT element$
Jerry
----
Creating a list with initial values:
----
~A = [1,2,3,4]
----

=== Strings as numeric buffers
Engine BASIC tries to make it easy to use strings as general-purpose buffers that
have a lower overhead and use less memory than arrays or lists.

To create a string from a sequence of byte-sized numbers, a string initializer
can be used:
----
A$ = [65, 66, 67]
PRINT A$
ABC
----
Individual characters can be set and retrieved as numbers:
----
PRINT A$[0]
65
----
