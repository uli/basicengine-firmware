PROGRAM FILE 169: EXCEPTION - NUMERIC UNDERFLOW IN THE
        EVALUATION OF NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS ACTING AS 
        ARGUMENTS AND SUBSCRIPTS.
    ANSI STANDARD 6.4, 7.4, 7.6, 8.4

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THAT THE HANDLING OF
UNDERFLOW OCCURRING DURING THE EVALUATION OF NUMERIC
EXPRESSIONS WORKS PROPERLY IN CONTEXTS OTHER THAN SIMPLE
ASSIGNMENT OF THE EXPRESSION TO A VARIABLE. SPECIFICALLY,
EXPRESSIONS ARE USED AS ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTIONS AND
SUBSCRIPTS OF ARRAYS.

SECTION 169.1: NUMERIC UNDERFLOW IN AN ARGUMENT TO A
        SUPPLIED FUNCTION.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING AN EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE ARGUMENT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EVALUATE EXP(1E-20 ^ 5000).


RESULT OF EXP(1E-20 ^ 5000) = 1

*** TEST PASSED ***

                    END TEST.

SECTION 169.2: NUMERIC UNDERFLOW IN AN ARRAY SUBSCRIPT.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING AN EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE SUBSCRIPT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EVALUATE Z(-1E-20 ^ 5001), WHERE Z(I) = I + 100.


RESULT OF Z(-1E-20 ^ 5001) = 100

*** TEST PASSED ***

                    END TEST.
