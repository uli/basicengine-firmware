PROGRAM FILE 101: EXCEPTION - NUMERIC OVERFLOW ON READ.
    ANSI STANDARD 14.5

SECTION 101.1: EXCEPTION - POSITIVE OVERFLOW ON READ.

THIS TEST CAUSES 9.9E99999 TO BE READ INTO A NUMERIC
VARIABLE. IN ORDER TO PASS, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:

1) CORRECTLY ACCEPT THE NUMBER AND RETAIN ITS VALUE IN
   THE VARIABLE, AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PRINTING, OR

2) DETECT NUMERIC OVERFLOW, REPORT THE EXCEPTION,
   SUPPLY POSITIVE MACHINE INFINITY AND CONTINUE.

                 BEGIN TEST

ABOUT TO EXECUTE READ.

RESULTING VALUE IN VARIABLE = inf

IF EXCEPTION OCCURRED, VARIABLE SHOULD = POSITIVE INFINITY.
IF NOT, IT SHOULD = 9.9E99999; OTHERWISE,
***  TEST FAILED  *** 

                 END TEST

SECTION 101.2: EXCEPTION - NEGATIVE OVERFLOW ON READ

THIS SECTION IS IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS, EXCEPT THAT
-9.9E99999 IS USED TO CAUSE OVERFLOW.

                 BEGIN TEST

ABOUT TO EXECUTE READ.

RESULTING VALUE IN VARIABLE = -inf

IF EXCEPTION OCCURRED, VARIABLE SHOULD = NEGATIVE INFINITY.
IF NOT, IT SHOULD = -9.9E99999; OTHERWISE,
***  TEST FAILED  *** 

                 END TEST

END PROGRAM 101
