PROGRAM FILE 25: MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, AND INVOLUTE
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THE GROSS SEMANTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, AND INVOLUTION OPERATORS FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.

EXPRESSIONS USING ONLY ONE OPERATOR AND CONSTANTS AND
SIMPLE VARIABLES ARE EVALUATED, AND THE RESULTS TESTED
AGAINST THE CORRECT VALUE. CONSTANTS ARE EXPRESSED IN
NR1, NR2, AND NR3 FORM. THE VALUES OF THE OPERANDS AND
RESULTS ARE RESTRICTED TO INTEGERS AND SIMPLE FRACTIONS
TO AVOID ACCURACY PROBLEMS (ACCURACY IS ADDRESSED IN
LATER TESTS).
