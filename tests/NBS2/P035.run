PROGRAM FILE 35: EXCEPTION - OVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW WITHIN
        SUB-EXPRESSIONS
    ANSI STANDARD 7.4, 7.5

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THE EFFECT OF NUMERIC OVERFLOW AND
UNDERFLOW WITHIN A SUB-EXPRESSION ON THE CONTAINING
EXPRESSION.

SECTION 35.1: SUB-EXPRESSION OVERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE EFFECT ON AN EXPRESSION OF NUMERIC
OVERFLOW WITHIN ONE OF ITS SUB-EXPRESSIONS.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) MACHINE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE SUB-EXPRESSION.

               BEGIN TEST

ABOUT TO COMPUTE -.01 * (10 ^ 99999)
RESULT = -inf

IF RESULT = (-.01 * MACHINE INFINITY)
   AND OVERFLOW EXCEPTION REPORTED, THEN
*** TEST PASSES *** OTHERWISE *** TEST FAILS ***

                END TEST

SECTION 35.2: SUB-EXPRESSION UNDERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE EFFECT OF AN EXPRESSION OF NUMERIC
UNDERFLOW WITHIN ONE OF ITS OPERATIONS.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE SUB-EXPRESSION.

               BEGIN TEST

ABOUT TO COMPUTE 3 + (10 ^ (-99999))
RESULT = 3

*** TEST PASSED ***

                END TEST

END PROGRAM 35
