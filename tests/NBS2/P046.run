        THE FOR-STATEMENT.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT A GOSUB ROUTINE CAN BE EXPECTED
FROM WITHIN A FOR-BLOCK.

               BEGIN TEST.

CONTROL VARIABLE:
SHOULD BE	ACTUAL	RESULT
8	8	  OK  
4	4	  OK  
0	0	  OK  
-4	-4	  OK  
LOOP EXITED
-8	-8	  OK  

NO. TIMES THROUGH LOOP:
SHOULD BE: 4     ACTUAL: 4    RESULT:   OK  

*** TEST PASSED ***

               END TEST.

SECTION 46.2: FOR-LOOPS WITH SAME CONTROL-VARIABLE
        NESTED DYNAMICALLY WITH GOSUB.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT A GOSUB ROUTINE CAN BE EXECUTED
FROM WITHIN A FOR-BLOCK AND THAT THE SUBROUTINE MAY ITSELF
CONTAIN A FOR-BLOCK. IF THE TWO FOR-BLOCKS USE THE SAME
CONTROL-VARIABLE, THE ORIGINAL VALUE IS LOST.

               BEGIN TEST.

CONTROL VARIABLE:
SHOULD BE	ACTUAL	RESULT
ENTERING OUTER LOOP
8	8	  OK  
ENTERING INNER LOOP
-10	-10	  OK  
-8	-8	  OK  
INNER LOOP EXITED
-6	-6	  OK  
OUTER LOOP EXITED
-9	-9	  OK  

NO. TIMES THROUGH INNER LOOP:
SHOULD BE: 2     ACTUAL: 2   RESULT:   OK  


NO. TIMES THROUGH OUTER LOOP:
SHOULD BE: 1     ACTUAL: 1   RESULT:   OK  

*** TEST PASSED ***

SECTION 46.3 CONTROL-STATEMENT JUMPS OUT OF FOR-BLOCK.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT YOU CAN JUMP OUT OF A FOR-BLOCK
AND THAT THE CONTROL-VARIABLE RETAINS ITS VALUE WHEN
THIS HAPPENS.

             BEGIN TEST.

LOOP IS: FOR I1=33 TO 66 STEP 4

CONTROL VARIABLE:
SHOULD BE	ACTUAL	RESULT
33	33	  OK  
37	37	  OK  
41	41	  OK  
45	45	  OK  
49	49	  OK  
53	53	  OK  
57	57	  OK  
61	61	  OK  
JUMPED OUT OF LOOP
61	61	  OK  

NO. TIMES THROUGH LOOP:
SHOULD BE: 8     ACTUAL: 8     RESULT:   OK

LOOP IS: FOR I1=7 TO 7 STEP 0

CONTROL VARIABLE:

7	7	  OK  
7	7	  OK  
7	7	  OK  
7	7	  OK

NO. TIMES THROUGH LOOP:
SHOULD BE: 5     ACTUAL: 5    RESULT:   OK
