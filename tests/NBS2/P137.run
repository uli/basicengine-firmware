SECTION 137.1: POKER TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM CATEGORIZES FIXED-SIZE GROUPS OF RANDOM NUMBERS
BASED ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUMBER ARE IN EACH
GROUP. A TYPE IS DETERMINED BY WHICH FRACTION OF THE 0 - 1
SEGMENT THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER FALLS WITHIN. CHI-SQUARE
IS THEN COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT TO SEE IF
IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM
RANDOM NUMBERS.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                    BEGIN TEST

RUNNING 12005 TRIALS, SO THAT EACH POSSIBILITY HAS
EXPECTED VALUE >= 5, AS NEEDED FOR CHI-SQUARE TEST.

#TYPES	ACTUAL COUNT	EXPECTED COUNT
1	6	5
2	460	450
3	3680	3750
4	6001	6000
5	1858	1800

FOR FOUR D.F., SHOULD HAVE .710721 <= CHI-SQ <= 9.48773
(5% TAIL AT EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ = 3.59794444

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

                   END TEST
