    ANSI STANDARD 8.4

SECTION 140.1: RUNS TEST FOR THE RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM COUNTS HOW MANY RUNS OF A GIVEN LENGTH OCCUR
WITHIN A SERIES OF RANDOM NUMBERS. A RUN IS A SUBSEQUENCE
OF THE NUMBERS WITHIN WHICH THE VALUES ARE IN ASCENDING
ORDER. THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THE EXPECTED OUTCOME
FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS, AND CHI-SQUARE IS COMPUTED
AND DISPLAYED. ALL RUNS OF LENGTH >= 6 ARE CONSOLIDATED
INT ONE CATEGORY.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                  BEGIN TEST

RUN LENGTH	ACTUAL COUNT	EXPECTED COUNT
1	855	833.335
2	1009	1041.665
3	455	458.3335
4	146	131.9445
5	32	28.76985
>=6	3	5.9524

FOR 6 D.F., SHOULD HAVE 1.63539 <= CHI-SQ <= 12.5916
(5% TAIL ON EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ = 5.19782696

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

                 END TEST
