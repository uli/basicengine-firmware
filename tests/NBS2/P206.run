PROGRAM FILE 206: ERROR - ORDERING RELATIONS BETWEEN STRINGS.
    ANSI STANDARD 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 10.2

THIS PROGRAM TESTS WHETHER, AS AN ENHANCEMENT, THE COMPARISON
OF STRINGS WITH THE '<' AND '>' RELATIONS IS ALLOWED.

THIS IS A TEST FOR A NON-STANDARD FEATURE OF MINIMAL BASIC.
TO PASS THIS TEST, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:

   1) ACCEPT THE PROGRAM AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOCUMENTATION
      ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE FEATURE'S INTERPRETATION
      BY THE PROCESSOR, OR

   2) REJECT THE PROGRAM WITH AN APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE

SEE THE NBS MINIMAL BASIC TEST PROGRAMS USER'S MANUAL
FOR DETAILED CRITERIA.

SECTION 206.1: COLLATING SEQUENCE.

IF THIS IMPLEMENTATION ALLOWS THE ORDERING RELATIONS,
AN INFORMATIVE SORT IS DONE TO DISPLAY THE IMPLICIT
COLLATING SEQUENCE OF THE CHARACTERS (ASSUMING THE NATURAL
INTERPRETATION IS GIVEN TO THESE RELATIONS).

                    BEGIN TEST.

COLLATING SEQUENCE OF SELECTED CHARACTERS IS:
(CHARACTERS SURROUNDED BY PERIODS)

. .!.#.$.%.&.'.(.).*.+.,.-.../.
.1.8.9.:.;.<.=.>.?.A.M.O.Z.^._.

IF DOCUMENTATION AGREES WITH THE ABOVE RESULTS, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***

                     END TEST.

SECTION 206.2: COLLATING MULTI-CHARACTER STRINGS.

THIS SECTION DISPLAYS SOME SUGGESTIVE TEST CASES TO
SHOW HOW THIS IMPLEMENTATION HANDLES COMPARISONS OF
MULTI-CHARACTER STRINGS. ALL STRINGS SHOWN ARE DELIMITED
BY APOSTROPHES TO ENABLE THE USER TO DISTINGUISH BLANKS
FROM NULL.

                    BEGIN TEST.

'ABC' = 'ABC'
'ABC' , 'ABD'
'ABC' , 'XYZ'
'ABC' , 'ABC  '
'ABC' , '  ABC'
'ABC  ' > '  ABC'
'ABC' , 'ABCD'
'ABC' > '  '
'ABC' > ''
'' , '  '
'  ' , '    '
'  ABC' > ' '
'  ABC' > '  '
'  ABC' > '   '

IF DOCUMENTATION AGREES WITH ABOVE RESULTS, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***

                     END TEST.
