PROGRAM FILE 23: INITIALIZATION OF STRING AND NUMERIC
        VARIABLES.
    ANSI STANDARD 6.6

SECTION 23.1: INITIALIZATION OF STRING OF NUMERIC
        VARIABLES.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION TREATS
UNINITIALIZED VARIABLES. THE MINIMAL BASIC STANDARD
RECOMMENDS THAT THIS CONDITION BE TREATED AS AN 
EXCEPTION. IN ANY CASE, THE DOCUMENTATION MUST
DESCRIBE THE ACTION OF THE PROCESSOR IN ORDER
FOR THE TEST TO PASS.

                         BEGIN TEST.

NEITHER A$ OR Y HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A VALUE.

THE IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED INITIAL VALUE (SURROUNDED
    BY APOSTROPHES) FOR A$=''
THE IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED INITIAL VALUE FOR Y =0

IF THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION CORRECTLY
   DESCRIBES THE RESULTS ABOVE, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***

                          END TEST.

END PROGRAM 23
