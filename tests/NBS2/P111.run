PROGRAM FILE 111: EXCEPTION - NUMERIC UNDERFLOW ON INPUT
        CAUSES REPLACEMENT BY ZERO.
    ANSI STANDARD 5.6, 13.4

SECTION 111.1: EXCEPTION - NUMERIC UNDERFLOW ON INPUT
        CAUSES REPLACEMENT BY ZERO.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE OF THE
       NUMERIC CONSTANT IN THE INPUT-REPLY.

AFTER THE INPUT-PROMPT, ENTER 1E-99999. THIS IS INTENDED
TO CAUSE NUMERIC UNDERFLOW. IF IT DOES, THE PROCESSOR
MUST SET THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE TO ZERO.

SINCE '1E-99999' IS A SYNTACTICALLY LEGAL NUMBER,
IF THE PROCESSOR DOES NOT ACCEPT 1E-99999 AS INPUT,
***  TEST FAILS  ***

                                BEGIN TEST.

ENTER 1E-99999
1E-99999

RESULTING VALUE=0

*** TEST PASSED ***

                                END TEST.

END PROGRAM 111
