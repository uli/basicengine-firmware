PROGRAM FILE 84: ERROR - DIMENSIONING THE SAME ARRAY 
        MORE THAN ONCE.
    ANSI STANDARD 15.4

*** NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF THE INPUT STATEMENT
    WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED. IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS SHOW
    THIS FEATURE TO BE INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, THEN THE 
    VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ROUTINE IS DOUBTFUL.

SECTION 84.1: ERROR - DIMENSIONING THE SAME ARRAY 
        MORE THAN ONCE.

THIS IS A TEST FOR A NON-STANDARD FEATURE OF MINIMAL BASIC.
TO PASS THIS TEST, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:

   1) ACCEPT THE PROGRAM AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOCUMENTATION
      ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE FEATURE'S INTERPRETATION
      BY THE PROCESSOR, OR

   2) REJECT THE PROGRAM WITH AN APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE

SEE THE NBS MINIMAL BASIC TEST PROGRAMS USER'S MANUAL
FOR DETAILED CRITERIA.

               BEGIN TEST

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT INTERPRETATION IS GIVEN TO A
DOUBLY-DIMENSIONED ARRAY, YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM
THREE TIMES, AND NOTE EACH TIME WHETHER A SUBSCRIPT-OUT-
OF-RANGE EXCEPTION OCCURS. THE TABLE BELOW GIVES THE
EXPECTED RESULTS FOR EACH OF FIVE POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS.

RESULTS WHICH DO NOT MATCH ANY OF THE ROWS IN THE TABLE
INDICATE THAT SOME OTHER INTERPRETATION IS BEING USED.

TABLE OF RESULTS: THE THREE COLUMNS STAND FOR 1ST, 2ND, AND
3RD EXECUTION, AND THE FIVE ROWS STAND FOR FIVE POSSIBLE
INTERPRETATIONS.

          DID EXCEPTION OCCUR?

               1      2      3
INT NO. 1     YES    YES    YES
INT NO. 2     YES    YES    NO
INT NO. 3     NO     NO     NO
INT NO. 4     YES    NO     NO
INT NO. 5     NO     YES    NO

INTERPRETATION NUMBER 1 IS THAT THE FIRST DIM-STATEMENT IN
THE SOURCE CODE GOVERNS THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY.

INTERPRETATION NUMBER 2 IS THAT THE DIM-STATEMENT MOST
RECENTLY PRECEDING AN ARRAY REFERENCE IN THE SOURCE CODE
DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY AT THAT REFERENCE.

INTERPRETATION NUMBER 3 IS THAT THE LAST DIM-STATEMENT IN
THE SOURCE CODE DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY.

INTERPRETATION NUMBER 4 IS THAT THE FIRST DIM-STATEMENT
EXECUTED DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY.

INTERPRETATION NUMBER 5 IS THAT THE DIM-STATEMENT MOST
RECENTLY EXECUTED DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY.

IS THIS THE 1ST, 2ND OR 3RD EXECUTION (RESPOND 1, 2, OR 3)?
