THIS PROGRAM TESTS THE EFFECT OF THE VARIOUS EXCEPTIONS THAT
CAN OCCUR IN NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRINT
STATEMENT.

SECTION 174.1: EXCEPTIONAL EXPRESSIONS AS PRINT-ITEMS.

THIS SECTION TESTS THE EFFECT OF PRINTING EXPRESSIONS WHICH
CAUSE NON-FATAL EXCEPTIONS.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) FOUR EXCEPTIONS MUST BE REPORTED; OVERFLOW, DIVISION
       BY ZERO, ZERO RAISED TO A NEGATIVE POWER, AND
       OVERFLOW OF EXP FUNCTION, AND

    2) NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, AND POSITIVE MACHINE
       INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUES OF THE
       EXPRESSIONS AND THEN PRINTED.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EXECUTE:
   PRINT (-1E-33) ^ (-3333), (-1E-33) / 0, 0 ^ (-1E-33), EXP(1E20)

*** TEST PASSED ***

                    END TEST.

SECTION 174.2: EXCEPTIONAL EXPRESSIONS AS TAB-ITEMS.

THIS SECTION TESTS THE EFFECT OF OVERFLOW IN A TAB-ITEM.

    1) THE OVERFLOW EXCEPTION MUST BE REPORTED, AND

    2) EXECUTION CONTINUES, WITH THE TAB EVALUATING TO
       SOME ARBITRARY PRINT POSITION.

                    BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EXECUTE:
   PRINT TAB(9^(9^9));X$
   (WHERE X$ = 'X')
