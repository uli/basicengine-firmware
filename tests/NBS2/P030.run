PROGRAM FILE 30: EXCEPTION - OVERFLOW OF NUMERIC CONSTANTS.
    ANSI STANDARD 5.4, 5.5

THIS PROGRAM TESTS VARIOUS CASES OF CONSTANT OVERFLOW.

SECTION 30.1: POSITIVE CONSTANT OVERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE RESULT OF CONSTANT EVALUATION
EXCEEDING POSITIVE MACHINE INFINITY.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) POSITIVE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE CONSTANT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

               BEGIN TEST

RESULT OF ASSIGNING E399999 = inf
IF (RESULT = 3E99999) OR 
   (RESULT = POSITIVE INFINITY AND EXCEPTION REPORTED)
*** TEST PASSED *** OTHERWISE *** TEST FAILED ***

                END TEST

SECTION 30.2: NEGATIVE CONSTANT OVERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE RESULT OF CONSTANT EVALUATION
EXCEEDING NEGATIVE MACHINE INFINITY.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) NEGATIVE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE CONSTANT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

               BEGIN TEST

RESULT OF ASSIGNING -3E99999 = -inf
IF (RESULT = -3E99999) OR 
   (RESULT = NEGATIVE INFINITY AND EXCEPTION REPORTED)
*** TEST PASSES *** OTHERWISE *** TEST FAILS *** 

                END TEST
