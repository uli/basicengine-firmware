          BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

FOR THIS PROGRAM,WE ASSUME THAT A COMPANY HAS CERTAIN
FIXED COSTS. tHIS COMPANY IS SELLING AN ITEM SUCH THAT
VARIABLE COST/UNIT SOLD OF THAT ITEM IS KNOWN. wE ALSO
KNOW THE PRICE AT WHICH THE ITEM IS SOLD. gIVEN THIS
INFORMATION WE CAN COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF THE
ITEM WHICH THE COMPANY MUST SELL TO JUST BREAK EVEN,
I.E. SO THAT THE NET SALE REVENUE JUST COVERS FIXED
COSTS. WE CAN ALSO COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THE
COMPANY MUST SELL TO MAKE ANY GIVEN PROFIT. THIS
PROGRAM  WILL DO BOTH TYPES OF COMPUTATIONS.
