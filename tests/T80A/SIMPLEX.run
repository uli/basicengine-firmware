LINEAR PROGRAMMING

LINEAR PROGRAMMING IS A MATHEMATICAL TOOL DESIGNED TO HELP
MANAGEMENT TO MAKE OPTIMUM USE OF COMPETING RESOURCES.
IT IS A VERY POPULAR TECHNIQUE AND INVOLVES LINEAR INEQUALITIES
CALLED CONSTRAINTS AND A LINEAR OBJECTIVE FUNCTION WHICH
WE TRY TO MAXIMIZE OR MINIMIZE. THE INTERESTED USER MAY
CONSULT ANY INTRODUCTORY TEXT IN FINITE MATHEMATICS FOR
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE NUMBERS OF VARIABLES AND CONSTRAINTS ARE ONLY
LIMITED BY AVAILABLE MEMORY BUT MANY VARIABLE PROBLEMS
MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RUN.

PRESS ENTER TO BEGIN
NUMBER OF VARIABLES    2
NUMBER OF CONSTRAINTS  1
NAME OF VARIABLE 1 IS X
NAME OF VARIABLE 2 IS Y

CONSTRAINT 1

COEFFICIENT FOR VARIABLE1  X IS 1.234
COEFFICIENT FOR VARIABLE2  Y IS 5.6789
ENTER 1 IF <= CONSTRAINT, -1 IF >= CONSTRAINT 1
ENTER AMOUNT FOR CONSTRAINT  9.876




PRESS Y IF A MINIMIZATION PROBLEM, OTHERWISE NN

ENTER COEFFICIENTS FOR OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

COEFFICIENT FOR VARIABLE1  X IS 1.111
COEFFICIENT FOR VARIABLE2  Y IS 2.222
VALUE OF OBJECTIVE FUNCTION = 0

AMOUNT OF X I.E. X(1) = 0
AMOUNT OF Y I.E. X(2) = 0
