LOAN RATE WITH COMPENSATING BALANCE

WHEN A BUSINESSMAN BORROWS MONEY FROM A BANK HE IS SOMETIMES
REQUIRED TO KEEP A COMPENSATING BALANCE IN THE ACCOUNT.
A COMPENSATING BALANCE IS AN AMOUNT THAT THE BUSINESSMAN
PAYS INTEREST ON(AS HE HAS BORROWED IT) BUT WHICH HE
CANNOT WITHDRAW FROM HIS ACCOUNT. IF A 15% COMPENSATING
BALANCE IS REQUIRED,E.G. THIS MEANS THAT FOR EVERY $1,000
BORROWED THE BUSINESSMAN CAN ONLY WRITE CHECKS FOR $850.
THIS IS ONE METHOD A BANK USES TO RAISE THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST
RATE ON A LOAN. THE NOMINAL RATE ,IN THIS CASE, IS LOWER
THAN THE 'TRUE' EFFECTIVE RATE.
