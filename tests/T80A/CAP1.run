CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL ANALYSIS OF PROJECT
THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL  STUDIES THE RISK-RETURN
IMPACT OF AN INVESTMENT PROPOSAL UPON AN INVESTOR'S PORTFOLIO
OF STOCKS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE MODEL GIVES THE EXPECTED
RETURN FOR AN INVESTMENT GIVEN THE EXPECTED RETURN FOR THE
MARKET AS A WHOLE, THE RISK-FREE(I.E. U.S.TREASURY BOND)
INTEREST RATE, AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE RETURN ON THE INVEST-
MENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REST OF THE MARKET. A VOLATILITY OF
1 MEANS THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WILL CHANGE JUST AS THE
MARKET CHANGES, A VOLATILTY GREATER THAN 1 MEANS THE INVEST-
MENT'S RETURN MOVES IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE MARKET BUT
AT A MORE RAPID RATE. VOLATILITY OF 0 MEANS THE RETURN ON THE
INVESTMENT IS INDEPENDENT OF MARKET MOVEMENT. NEGATIVE
VOLATILITY MEANS RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT AND THE MARKET MOVE
IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
