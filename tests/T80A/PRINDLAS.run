LASPEYRES PRICE INDEX

COMPARING PRICES AT A FIXED TIME IN THE PAST, CALLED THE
BASE YEAR TO CURRENT PRICES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE. THIS IS
BECAUSE NEW ITEMS HIT THE MARKET AND USE OF OTHER ITEMS
CHANGE THROUGH THE YEARS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR USES
A METHOD BY WHICH QUANTITIES FOR THE BASE YEAR ARE USED AND
ARE WEIGHTED ONCE WITH BASE YEAR PRICES AND ONCE WITH CURRENT
PRICES. THESE TWO WEIGHTINGS ARE DIVIDED AND THE QUOTIENT
IS MULTIPLIED BY 100 GIVING THE LASPEYRES PRICE INDEX.
IF THE INDEX IS GREATER THAN 100 THEN PRICES HAVE INCREASED.
