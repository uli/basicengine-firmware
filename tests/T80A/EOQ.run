         EOQ INVENTORY MODEL 

IN INVENTORY THEORY A REORDER COST IS A FIXED COST ASSESSED
EACH TIME AN ORDER FOR AN ITEM IS PLACED, NO MATTER WHAT
THE ORDER QUANTITY IS.
A HOLDING COST IS A COST DUE TO HOLDING INVENTORY,E.G.INTEREST.
A STOCKOUT COST IS DUE TO RUNNING OUT OF AN ITEM.

WE CAN TAKE DELIVERY OF A REORDER WHENEVER WE WANT.
DEMAND IS IN NUMBER OF ITEMS USED PER YEAR.
REORDER COST IS IN DOLLARS PER REORDER.
