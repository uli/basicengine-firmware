THIS PROGRAM WILL CALCULATE THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF

TURNS AND THE REQUIRED CORE PRODUCT GIVEN PARAMETERS

SUCH AS FREQUENCY, CURRENT DENSITY, SECONDARY LEVELS

AND FLUX DENSITY.

THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO CONDUCT A 'CORE SEARCH' IF A

CROSS SECTIOAL AREA IS NOT SPECIFIED.  THIS SEARCH

WILL RESULT IN A NUMBER OF DESIGNS BASED ON CORES IN

THE MAGNETICS INC. CATALOG AND LIMITED BY THE USERS

AREA AND CORE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.
